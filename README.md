Created to rename a bunch of files from a previous backup.
These file all had the same UTC date appended to the end of the file name.

This tool asks you three things:
1. What directory to look in (changes are applied recursively).
2. What text you want to rename.
3. What do you want the text to be replaced with.

If a file has the same name, _* is added.
  File001.bin will become File001_1.bin while the orginal File001.bin remains the same.
